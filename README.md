My geospatial portfolio website to showcase the integration of Angular 7, Mapbox GL, PostGIS and Docker. The code repository above is production build code configured for Docker Compose instances. If you run Docker locally, 'git clone https://github.com/geospatialweb/Angular.git' then run 'npm install' then 'docker-compose up -d'. If you want to run localhost on a node server, you will have to create a local pg database populated via the sql script in '/data' plus make a few specific code edits for localhost db url and live reloading/debugging capabilities. If you want to go the latter route, please email me at 'johncampbell@geospatialweb.ca' for further instructions...
